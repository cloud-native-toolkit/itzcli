# Sample .atk.yaml file for configuration of the ATK CLI.
# You will want to update this and put this file in your home directory and name it
# `.atk.yaml`.
#
# If you have this pulled down as source and have the make tools installed,
# you can "install" this configuration file by typing `make install-config`
# It will fail if the file already exists, which is on purpose.
#
# Note that because of Viper goodness, any one of these configuration values
# may be overridden by using environment variables that begin with ATK and use
# the "_" character for a delimiter. See examples for the `ci` key
